# 03-Text-adventure

Running the main.py file will allow you to play my game.

I have edited the game.json file to house the game I have completed for the assignment, and have elimainated all other game choices when asked which one you'd like to play.

I have added a couple verbs to the input list, so while going through the game use the new (FORWARD, RIGHT, LEFT, or BACK) commands to progress through the game. 

I hope you enjoy!
